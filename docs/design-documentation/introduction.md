# Introduction

The to-do list application is a web-based tool that allows users to create, manage, and track their daily tasks. The application will be designed for use on desktop and mobile devices.

# Background

There are many to-do list applications available on the market, but many of them are either too complex or lack important features. The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet powerful to-do list application that meets the needs of a wide range of users.
